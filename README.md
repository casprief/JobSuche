#	Jobsuche

Website developed in PHP and MySQL, which aims to model a job search engine.

For the style, the Jumbotron from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/examples/) was implemented in combination with the stylesheet Celurean from [Boostwatch](https://bootswatch.com/).

The parameters of the DB are given in the `/config/config.php` file.
